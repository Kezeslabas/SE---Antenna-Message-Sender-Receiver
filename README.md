# SE---Antenna-Message-Sender-Receiver
This is an in-game script made for the game, Space Engineers, and it's available in the Steam Workhsop. The script is capable of sending and receiving messages to/from other grids remotely, by using Antennas. You can send a message to only one Receiver Block, but you can receive a message from multiple Sender Blocks. On the Receiving Side, the script can write out the messages to LCDs, or can Trigger/Start Timer Blocks. It's ideal to use it to open Doors remotely.
